### üåê About Me

Hey there! So, let me tell you a bit about my journey in the tech world.

My love for technology began in 2010 when I stumbled upon some free programming classes online and started practicing almost every day, crafting blogs and websites just for fun. 

This passion led me to pursue a degree in System Analysis at UFMS, obtain certifications from freeCodeCamp, selected for the AWS re/Start program in 2023 and Google Cloud Get Certified in 2024.

Throughout my career, I've worn many hats ‚Äì from being an event monitor in college to working as an IT assistant.

But what really got me going was software development. I've been busy crafting blogs, APIs, websites, and more. And hey, guess what? Now I'm diving into the world of cloud engineering!

With almost 8 years of experience under my belt as software engineer, I can honestly say I've been having a blast! It's been a journey filled with hands-on experience and tons of learning along the way.

As a self-proclaimed Node.js enthusiast, I've even participated in programming competitions and contributed to various open-source projects.

Now, I'm itching for new opportunities to shift gears from problem-solving to crafting the best projects with my experience.

My drive? Solving tough challenges! I'm all about striving for software greatness, focusing on solutions that bring stability, efficiency, and that perfect cost/benefit balance.

When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy creating music, which you can check out on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/hpbonfim).

### üèóÔ∏è System Design

I have hands-on experience with various system design patterns:

- **Monolithic Architecture:** Building simple, cohesive applications that are easier to deploy and debug in a single environment.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Structuring applications as collections of small services that promote modularity and scalability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Triggering workflows through events for real-time systems and loose coupling.
- **Database Sharding & Partitioning:** Enhancing performance and scaling database solutions effectively.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across servers to maintain efficiency and reduce bottlenecks.
- **Caching Strategies:** Using caching layers (e.g., Redis) to improve application response times.
- **CDN Integration:** Leveraging CDNs to optimize content delivery for a global user base.
